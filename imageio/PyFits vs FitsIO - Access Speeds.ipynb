    "`pyfits` has much faster access speeds than `fitsio`. The difference is abyssal, with `pyfits` being $\\gt5x10^4$ faster than `fitsio`. This drastic time difference is very strange; implying `fitsio` does not use memory-maps by default (since the timings for `pyfits.sections` is similar in magnitude to those of `fitsio`). Also, should be noted that using `pyfits.sections` is not as fast as normal accessing, and ought to avoided whenever possible. It is the minimum performance benchmark, and only should be used when all other loading methods are inadequate.\n",
