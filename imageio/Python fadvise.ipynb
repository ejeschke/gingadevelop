    "1. There is a pattern to the first loading function taking longer than the subsequent calls, regardless of the function used. This implies that there might be some OS optimization that is not regulated by `python-fadvise` or the way we're clearing the file out of cache is not good enough. Unfortunately, this makes testing harder to judge. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. On the opposite end, advising a sequential access to `fitsio` may result in faster loading times with very large files. Look at `10000x10000.fits` and `15000x15000.fits` for examples of this. This trend is missing from the first run, where sequential access was tested last, hence this should be tested more in order to say anything conclusive. My guess is that the file might start have been cached intially or something to that effect, speeding up the first load. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The subsequent loading of `15000x15000.fits` is strangely cached not by the OS, but by the `pyfits` library. When loading with `pyfits`, the first call takes ~8 secs but later calls take ~3 secs. This does not happen with `cfitsio` (constant ~8 secs regardless of advising or order of loading functions). Possible topic to investigate. Same behavior occurs with `10000x10000.fits`. "
